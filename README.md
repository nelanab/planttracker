# Technical Feasibility
## Individual skillsets
Limitation of skillset individual members currently possess.
## Trial services
Chance of increased TCO from use of lowest-tier plans offered by development tools and services.
## Limited resources for testing real-life application
Low-tier plans cap opportunities for high-volume load testing.

# Operational Feasibility
## Workflow of development tools
Lack or possibility of the integrity of over several services utilized for development.
## Deployment
Anticipated low population of real users to source feedback from.
## Long term management and support
Expiration of development services licensed under education accounts.

# Economic Feasibility
## Training to further individual knowedge
Alotting productive development time for self-study of development tools and services utilized for the project.
## Ease of maintenance
Development tools and services facilitating the adding, removing or updating of features & time spent and saved doing so.
